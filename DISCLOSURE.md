# AI Assistance Disclosure Policy

This repository follows a clear and consistent policy for disclosing the use of AI-assisted tools in the preparation of research artifacts.

## Scope

This policy applies to all materials in this repository, including:
- Research papers
- Appendices
- Briefs (executive, board-level)
- Diagrams and figures
- Repository documentation

## Use of AI Assistance

This research was produced with significant AI assistance across the analysis and synthesis pipeline:
- **GPT-5.2**: Data analysis, research report generation, appendix generation, and paper synthesis.
- **ChatGPT**: Idea conception and refinement of prompts.
- **ChatGPT Deep Research**: Finding citation sources.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Final edits (via GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code).

## Author Contributions

The author’s primary contributions include:
- Research idea, conception, and execution.
- Steering AI agents to deliver high-quality research outputs.
- Capturing all primary data for analysis across the studied AI tools.
- Developing the underlying analysis and generation pipelines.
- Final review and editorial oversight.

The main contribution of the author is the development and validation of this methodology for AI-driven forensic research.

## Responsibility and Claims

While the author provided the methodology and oversight, they do not claim individual analytical judgments, interpretations, or conclusions, which were derived through the AI-driven methodology described in the research. All AI-assisted outputs were reviewed and verified by the author prior to publication.

## Authorship

AI tools are not listed as authors or contributors. Their role is that of advanced assistive tools within a human-steered research pipeline.

## Updates

If future revisions involve materially different use of AI assistance, this policy and the affected artifacts will be updated accordingly.
