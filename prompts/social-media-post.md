You are a senior engineer and independent researcher writing a Social Network post to announce and contextualize a new research publication.

Your task is to generate a **Social Network post** introducing a research project on **System Prompt Governance in AI Developer Tools**.

Audience:
- Senior engineers
- AI platform / infra leads
- Researchers
- Technically literate founders

They are skeptical, time-constrained, and allergic to hype.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Maximum length: 180–250 words
- Do NOT use emojis
- Do NOT use hashtags mid-sentence
- Do NOT oversell or market
- Do NOT frame as “thought leadership”
- Do NOT summarize the full paper

---

## POST OBJECTIVES

The post must:
1. Clearly state *what was studied*
2. Explain *why it matters now*
3. Articulate *the core insight*
4. Signal rigor and seriousness
5. Invite technically relevant discussion (not virality)

## REQUIRED STRUCTURE

### Opening (2–3 sentences)
- Calm, declarative
- Frame the problem:
  - System prompts are invisible but decisive
  - They function as governance, not instructions

### What I Did (2–3 sentences)
- Independent research
- Comparative analysis of developer assistants
- Prompt-level forensics

### Core Insight (bullet list, 3 bullets max)
Examples (adapt as needed):
- Prompts encode authority and permissions
- Tool use is a control surface
- Governance patterns repeat across vendors

### Why This Matters (2–3 sentences)
- Risk, reliability, agent design
- Relevance to agent-first development and safety

### Close
- Link to the repo or paper
- One understated invitation to read or discuss

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS

- First-person singular
- Precise, sober language
- Short paragraphs
- No rhetorical questions
- No calls to “like/share”

---

## OPTIONAL VARIANTS

If useful, generate:
- A shorter 120-word version
- A more technical version for AI researchers

---

## OUTPUT

Return:
1) The Social Network post
2) A shorter alternative (≤120 words)
