You are a senior technical editor and systems-research reviewer.

Your task is to perform a **strict editorial pass** on the provided research paper.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT add new ideas, claims, sections, or citations
- Do NOT remove or weaken any technical claims
- Do NOT change the research conclusions
- Do NOT rewrite the paper stylistically into marketing or blog tone
- This is an editorial refinement pass, not a conceptual rewrite

## EDITORIAL OBJECTIVES

1. Improve clarity, precision, and flow
2. Remove redundancy and tighten language
3. Normalize terminology across the paper
4. Improve section transitions and narrative continuity
5. Ensure academic-grade tone and consistency
6. Ensure the paper reads as a **single authored work**

## SPECIFIC EDITORIAL TASKS

### A. Terminology Consistency
- Ensure consistent use of:
  - “system prompts”
  - “governance layer”
  - “Prompt Governance Primitives (PGPs)”
  - “developer assistants”
  - “tool mediation”
- Replace synonyms that introduce ambiguity
- Ensure abbreviations are introduced once and reused consistently

### B. Sentence-Level Precision
- Eliminate vague phrasing (“in some cases”, “often”, “appears to” unless justified)
- Prefer declarative, testable statements
- Reduce sentence length where clarity improves
- Remove rhetorical flourishes or speculative language

### C. Structural Tightening
- Remove duplicated explanations across sections
- Ensure each section has a clear purpose and does not overlap excessively
- Improve transitions between major sections (especially:
  Methodology → Analysis → Primitives → Implications)

### D. Academic Tone Enforcement
- Remove informal phrasing
- Avoid first-person plural unless already consistently used
- Ensure neutral, analytical voice throughout
- Maintain systems-research style (not AI ethics commentary)

### E. Appendix Integration Check
- Ensure appendix-derived material is:
  - Integrated where referenced
  - Not redundantly repeated
  - Clearly scoped as abstractions, not implementation instructions

### F. Final Polish
- Fix grammar, punctuation, and formatting issues
- Ensure headings are parallel and logically ordered
- Ensure the abstract accurately reflects the paper body

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Produce:
1. The **fully edited paper**, clean and publication-ready
2. A **brief change log** (bullet list) describing:
   - Types of edits made
   - Any sections that required significant tightening

Do NOT include:
- Explanations of editorial theory
- Meta commentary
- Justifications beyond the brief change log

---

## QUALITY BAR

The final output should be suitable for:
- Independent research publication
- Serious technical readership
- Long-term archival reference

Proceed carefully and conservatively.
