You are an expert technical editor and systems researcher. Your task is to apply **minimal, high-leverage editorial revisions** to the provided final research report. The goal is _tightening and clarification_, not expansion or reinterpretation.

Operate under these constraints:

**Global constraints**

- Do **not** change the core thesis, conclusions, or taxonomy.
- Do **not** add new sections, examples, or assistants.
- Do **not** introduce new terminology unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve the author’s analytical tone and architectural framing.
- Reduce redundancy where ideas are restated without adding new analytical value.
- Net length change should be **−10% to −15%**, primarily via compression.

**Specific edits to apply**

1. **Policy-sovereign clarification**

   - Add a single, explicit definition sentence early in Section 4.1 clarifying that “policy-sovereign” refers to _external adjudication mechanisms overriding model or user discretion_, not generic safety policy.
   - This sentence should prevent ambiguity without expanding the section.

2. **Tool mediation redundancy compression**

   - In Sections 4.3 and 5, identify overlapping descriptions of tool mediation as governance.
   - Compress repeated explanations while preserving at least one strong articulation of:

     - tools as control surfaces,
     - sequencing as autonomy throttling,
     - workflow rules as procedural governance.

3. **Hypothesis closure in Conclusion**

   - In Section 9 (Conclusion), explicitly restate the original hypothesis from Section 1.
   - Add one sentence that clearly states whether the hypothesis is:

     - confirmed,
     - partially confirmed, or
     - confirmed with stated limitations.

   - Do not add new evidence; summarize what is already shown.

4. **Terminology consistency**

   - Ensure consistent use of:

     - “governance constitution” / “constitutional regime”
     - “authority allocation”
     - “mode-based partitioning”

   - Remove near-synonyms that introduce drift (e.g., switching between equivalent phrases unnecessarily).

5. **Preserve all analytical distinctions**

   - Do not collapse:

     - authority models,
     - scope/visibility vs tool mediation,
     - correction vs termination.

   - Maintain all comparative distinctions and named outliers.

**Output requirements**

- Produce a **fully revised version of the report**, not a list of edits.
- Do not annotate changes.
- Do not explain what you changed.
- The result should read as a tighter, more precise final publication draft.
